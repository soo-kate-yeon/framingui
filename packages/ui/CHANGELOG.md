All notable changes to @framingui/ui will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.11] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Added `FramingUIProvider` to centralize runtime theme CSS injection and `data-theme` synchronization for consumer apps.

### Testing

- Added provider regression coverage for theme CSS injection, `data-theme` syncing, and mismatch warnings.

## [0.6.10] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Migrated all shipped theme recipes to v4-safe semantic variable utilities so consumer apps no longer depend on Tailwind palette registration for `brand-*` or `neutral-*` recipe classes.
- Removed unsupported runtime variable references from theme recipes, including stale `--bg-brand-default`, `--bg-brand-subtle`, and `--bg-canvas-950` usages.

### Testing

- Added regression coverage to ensure every published theme recipe stays free of legacy palette utilities and unsupported runtime variable references.

## [0.6.9] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Removed the unnecessary `@hookform/resolvers` peer requirement from the published runtime package because it is only used in Storybook examples.
- Widened the `lucide-react` peer range to support current `0.x` releases used by consumer apps.
- Widened the `tailwind-merge` peer range to support both v2 and v3 consumers.

## [0.6.8] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Widened the `@hookform/resolvers` peer dependency range to support both v3 and v5 consumer projects, removing install conflicts with modern React Hook Form setups.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Restored `Heading` and `Text` exports from the `@framingui/ui` package root so consumer apps can import typography primitives without runtime `undefined` component crashes.
- Removed stale compiled `src/index.js` artifacts from the source tree so local source consumers and tests resolve the current TypeScript entrypoint consistently.

### Testing

- Added a package-root export regression test covering `Heading` and `Text`.
- Verified the package with `pnpm --filter @framingui/ui exec vitest run __tests__/index.test.ts` and `pnpm --filter @framingui/ui build`.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Relaxed the `zod` peer dependency range to support both `zod@3` and `zod@4`, removing consumer peer warnings when `@framingui/ui` is installed via `@framingui/mcp-server`.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-07

### Changed

- Migrated component and template styling to the prefixless token naming scheme across the published React UI library.
- Refreshed template examples, docs, and theme-loading helpers to stay aligned with the updated token contract shipped by `@framingui/core` and `@framingui/tokens`.

### Testing

- Added and updated regression coverage for card, form, table, tabs, template rendering, and theme loader behavior under the new token naming model.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- Template exports now compose metadata from the `@framingui/core` catalog instead of duplicating template definitions in `@framingui/ui`.
- Added a direct runtime dependency on `@framingui/core` so published template exports resolve catalog data consistently.
- Template entrypoints now live under `@framingui/ui/templates` so general UI consumers do not pull template-only runtime code into client bundles.

### Removed

- Removed duplicate legacy `.jsx` template sources, duplicate `.stories.jsx` files, and duplicate registry tests.
