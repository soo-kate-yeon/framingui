This is the **recommended production workflow** for generating screens with Framingui.

## Overview

The 4-step workflow ensures:
- ✅ Correct component usage with inline props/variants
- ✅ Validated screen structure with auto-fix patches
- ✅ Theme recipes applied via the theme engine (generate_screen)
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Tailwind CSS properly configured

## Step 1/4: Get Screen Generation Context

**Tool:** \`get-screen-generation-context\`

**Purpose:** Gather all context needed to create a Screen Definition

**Input:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "description": "User dashboard with profile card and recent activity",
  "themeId": "minimal-workspace",
  "includeExamples": true
}
\`\`\`

**Output:**
- Matching screen templates
- Available components with **inline props and variants**
- Screen Definition JSON schema
- Example definitions
- Theme recipes

**When to use:**
- Beginning of every screen generation
- When you need component suggestions
- When exploring available templates

---

## Step 2/4: Validate Screen Definition

**Tool:** \`validate-screen-definition\`

**Purpose:** Ensure your Screen Definition JSON is correct before generating code

**Input:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "definition": {
    "id": "user-dashboard",
    "shell": "shell.web.dashboard",
    "page": "page.dashboard",
    "sections": [
      {
        "id": "header",
        "pattern": "section.container",
        "components": [...]
      }
    ]
  },
  "strict": true
}
\`\`\`

**Output:**
- \`valid\`: true/false
- \`errors\`: Array of validation errors with suggestions and **autoFix patches**
- \`warnings\`: Potential issues
- \`suggestions\`: Improvement recommendations with **autoFix patches**
- \`autoFixPatches\`: Aggregated JSON Patch operations to fix all issues

**When to use:**
- Always before generating code (Step 3)
- When fixing validation errors (apply autoFixPatches)
- When exploring screen structure improvements

---

## Step 3/4: Generate Screen Code (Theme Engine)

**Tool:** \`generate_screen\`

**Purpose:** Generate production-ready React code with theme styling applied

**CRITICAL:** This tool is the **theme application engine**. It:
- Applies theme recipes to components (minimal-workspace, classic-magazine, etc.)
- Converts Screen Definition → Production-ready code with correct Tailwind classes
- Without this tool, theme styling will NOT be applied!

**Input:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "screenDefinition": { /* validated Screen Definition from Step 2 */ },
  "outputFormat": "tailwind",
  "options": {
    "typescript": true,
    "prettier": false
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Output:**
- \`success\`: true/false
- \`code\`: Generated production-ready React code with theme applied
- \`cssVariables\`: CSS variable definitions (if applicable)
- \`dependencies\`: Required packages and install commands

**Output Formats:**
- \`tailwind\`: React + Tailwind CSS classes (recommended)
- \`css-in-js\`: React + styled-components or emotion
- \`react\`: Plain React component

**AFTER RECEIVING RESPONSE:**
- ALWAYS check the \`dependencies\` field
- If \`dependencies.external\` is non-empty → proceed to Step 4
- Display required packages to user before delivering code

**When to use:**
- Always after successful validation (Step 2)
- This is the core code generation step - do NOT skip it

---

## Step 4/4: Validate Environment (Optional but Recommended)

**Tool:** \`validate-environment\`

**Purpose:** Verify project has required packages and Tailwind is configured correctly

**Input:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "projectPath": "/path/to/package.json",
  "requiredPackages": ["@radix-ui/react-slot", "@radix-ui/react-avatar"],
  "checkTailwind": true
}
\`\`\`

**Output:**
- \`installed\`: Packages already in package.json
- \`missing\`: Packages that need installation
- \`installCommands\`: Commands for npm/yarn/pnpm/bun
- \`tailwind\`: Tailwind config validation results
  - \`issues\`: Problems found
  - \`fixes\`: How to fix each issue

**Tailwind Validation Checks:**
- ✅ tailwind.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs} exists
- ✅ @framingui/ui content paths included
- ✅ tailwindcss-animate plugin configured

**When to use:**
- After generating code (Step 3), when user's package.json path is known
- Before delivering code to user
- When user reports missing styles or animations

## Complete Example

\`\`\`
User: "Create a login page with email/password fields"

1. Call get-screen-generation-context({ description: "login page..." })
   → Receive template matches, components with inline props, schema

2. Generate Screen Definition JSON based on context
   → Call validate-screen-definition({ definition: {...} })
   → Apply autoFixPatches if any, re-validate if needed

3. Call generate_screen({ screenDefinition: {...}, outputFormat: "tailwind" })
   → Receive production-ready code WITH theme styling applied
   → Check dependencies field for required packages

4. Call validate-environment({ projectPath: "...", requiredPackages: [...] })
   → Show user missing packages and install commands
   → Warn about Tailwind config issues if any

5. Deliver code to user with complete setup instructions
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

**Validation fails in Step 2:**
- Read error messages carefully - they include suggestions and autoFix patches
- Apply autoFixPatches to auto-correct common issues
- Check token names match SPEC-LAYOUT-001
- Verify component IDs exist (use list-components)

**Code generation fails in Step 3:**
- Ensure Screen Definition passed validation in Step 2
- Check that the outputFormat is one of: tailwind, css-in-js, react
- Verify @framingui/core is properly installed

**Missing dependencies:**
- Always run Step 4 to verify environment
- Show install commands to user
- Check Tailwind config includes @framingui/ui paths

**Components render without styles:**
- Verify Tailwind content paths include @framingui/ui
- Check tailwindcss-animate plugin is configured
- Run validate-environment to diagnose

## Best Practices

1. ✅ Always follow all 4 steps in order
2. ✅ Validate before generating code (Step 2)
3. ✅ Use generate_screen for theme application (Step 3) - do NOT write code manually
4. ✅ Check environment before delivering code (Step 4)
5. ✅ Use strict validation mode for production
6. ✅ Include theme recipes for visual consistency
7. ✅ Use inline props from context instead of guessing

## Alternative Workflows

**Quick Prototyping (not production):**
- \`generate-blueprint\` → \`export-screen\` (skips validation and theme engine)

**Production (recommended):**
- Follow complete 4-step workflow above`,
