## What is Tekton?

Tekton is an AI-powered design token generator that uses the OKLCH color space to create perceptually uniform, accessible color palettes. Whether you're building a design system from scratch or refining an existing one, Tekton helps you generate consistent, production-ready tokens in seconds.

### Why OKLCH?

Traditional color spaces like HSL and RGB don't account for human color perception. A "50% lightness" in HSL can look drastically different across hues. OKLCH solves this by providing **perceptual uniformity** — colors with the same lightness value actually appear equally bright to the human eye.

## Quick Start

Getting started with Tekton takes just a few steps:

### Step 1: Open the Playground

Visit [framingui.com](https://framingui.com) and open the interactive playground. You'll see a real-time preview of your design tokens as you adjust parameters.

### Step 2: Configure Your Base Colors

Choose your brand's primary color, and Tekton will automatically generate:

- **Primary palette** — 10 shades from lightest to darkest
- **Semantic colors** — Success, warning, error, info
- **Neutral scale** — For text, backgrounds, and borders

### Step 3: Export Your Tokens

Export your design tokens in multiple formats:

- **CSS Custom Properties** — Ready to drop into any project
- **Tailwind CSS** — Direct integration with your Tailwind config
- **JSON** — For design tools and custom integrations

## Key Features

### Accessibility First

Every color combination is checked against WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios. Tekton flags any pairs that don't meet AA or AAA standards, so you can fix accessibility issues before they ship.

### Dark Mode Support

Generate light and dark mode palettes simultaneously. Tekton ensures both modes maintain the same visual hierarchy and contrast ratios.

### Component Preview

See your tokens applied to real UI components — buttons, cards, forms, and more. This helps you validate your design decisions in context before committing to them.

## What's Next?

Now that you have your design tokens, here are some next steps:

1. **Integrate with your codebase** — Copy the generated CSS or Tailwind config into your project
2. **Share with your team** — Export and share the token specification with designers and developers
3. **Iterate** — Use the playground to experiment with different color schemes and find the perfect palette

Tekton is designed to grow with your project. Start simple, and expand your design system as your needs evolve.
