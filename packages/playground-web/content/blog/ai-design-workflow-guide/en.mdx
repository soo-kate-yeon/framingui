# AI Design Workflow: From Tokens to Production UI

Building UI with AI doesn't have to mean inconsistent results. Here's how to create a workflow that produces production-ready components every time.

## The Problem with AI-Generated UI

Most AI coding tools guess at design decisions. Colors, spacing, typography—they hallucinate values that don't match your brand.

**The result?** Hours spent fixing generated code to match your design system.

## A Better Approach: Token-First Design

Instead of letting AI guess, give it the answers upfront:

1. **Define your tokens** — Colors, spacing, typography as structured data
2. **Connect via MCP** — Make tokens available to AI tools
3. **Generate with constraints** — AI follows your rules, not its imagination

## Setting Up Your Workflow

### Step 1: Structure Your Tokens

```typescript
// tokens/colors.ts
export const colors = {
  primary: {
    50: 'oklch(0.97 0.02 250)',
    500: 'oklch(0.55 0.15 250)',
    900: 'oklch(0.25 0.10 250)',
  },
  // ... more colors
}
```

### Step 2: Connect to AI Tools

With tekton/ui's MCP server, your tokens become available to Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code mcp add tekton
```

### Step 3: Generate Consistent UI

Now when you ask AI to build a component, it uses your actual design values:

```
"Create a primary button with hover state"
```

The AI knows your primary color is `oklch(0.55 0.15 250)`, not some random blue.

## Real Results

Teams using token-first AI workflows report:
- **70% faster** component development
- **Zero design inconsistencies** in generated code
- **Happier designers** (they finally trust the output)
