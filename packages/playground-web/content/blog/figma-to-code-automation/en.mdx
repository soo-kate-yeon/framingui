# Figma to Code: AI-Powered Design Automation

The gap between design and development has always been painful. Here's how AI and design tokens are finally bridging that divide.

## The Traditional Workflow (And Why It Breaks)

1. Designer creates mockup in Figma
2. Developer inspects, manually extracts values
3. Code gets written with hardcoded colors/spacing
4. Design changes, developer re-extracts everything
5. Repeat forever

**The problem:** Manual translation creates errors and slows everyone down.

## The Token-Based Workflow

With a token-based approach:

1. Designer works with token-aware Figma components
2. AI reads the design, maps to existing tokens
3. Code generates using your actual design system
4. Design changes? AI updates the mapping

**The result:** Consistent code, faster iteration, happier teams.

## How It Works

### 1. Token-Aware Figma Setup

Structure your Figma with semantic naming:

```
Colors/Primary/500 → maps to → tokens.colors.primary[500]
Spacing/md → maps to → tokens.spacing.md
```

### 2. AI Extraction

When AI analyzes your Figma design:

```typescript
// AI sees: Rectangle with #3B82F6 fill
// AI maps: tokens.colors.primary[500]
// AI generates: className="bg-primary-500"
```

### 3. Component Generation

Instead of pixel-perfect recreation, AI generates semantic code:

```tsx
// Generated component
export function FeatureCard() {
  return (
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <CardHeader>
        <Heading size="lg">{title}</Heading>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <Text color="muted">{description}</Text>
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Real-World Implementation

### With tekton/ui

1. Export your Figma frame
2. Provide to AI with MCP context
3. Get token-compliant code

```bash
# In Claude or Cursor with tekton MCP
"Convert this Figma design to a React component"
```

The AI knows your tokens, follows your patterns, generates consistent code.

## Key Benefits

| Traditional | Token-Based |
|-------------|-------------|
| Hours per component | Minutes per component |
| Hardcoded values | Semantic tokens |
| Manual updates | AI-assisted changes |
| Design drift | Guaranteed consistency |
