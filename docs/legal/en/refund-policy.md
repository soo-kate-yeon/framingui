## 2. Digital Product Nature

All products sold on Tekton are **digital goods** (React UI templates, design assets, and code packages). Due to the nature of digital products:

> **Once a product has been downloaded, refunds are generally not available.**

This is because digital products cannot be "returned" like physical goods, and access to the full product is granted immediately upon download.
