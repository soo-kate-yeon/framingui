# FramingUI

Production UI through an MCP-installed design system.

FramingUI is a design system for AI-assisted product teams. Instead of asking an agent to invent UI from scratch, you install FramingUI as an MCP server and give the agent a real component catalog, theme system, layout tokens, quota-backed tool workflow, and validated screen contracts.

The goal is simple: use MCP to build production UI with stronger contracts, fewer hallucinated components, and clearer integration steps.

FramingUI currently ships two runtime lanes: `@framingui/ui` for web React, and `@framingui/react-native` for Expo / React Native direct-write workflows. MCP still provides the contract, discovery, and validation layer on top.

## What FramingUI Includes

- `@framingui/mcp-server`: MCP server for discovery, screen workflows, validation, and project setup
- `@framingui/ui`: React UI components and styles
- `@framingui/react-native`: React Native runtime primitives and token consumption helpers
- `@framingui/core`: theme, token, and screen-generation utilities
- `@framingui/tokens`: token types and references
- `@framingui/styled`: token-aware styled-components helpers
- `@framingui/esbuild-plugin`: build-time token compliance checks

## Recommended Start

Install the MCP server in your project and let it wire up the design system:

```bash
npx -y @framingui/mcp-server@latest init
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
npx @framingui/mcp-server@latest login
```

Inspect the current account state when needed:

```bash
npx @framingui/mcp-server@latest whoami
```

This setup flow can:

- install `@framingui/ui`
- configure Tailwind content paths and `tailwindcss-animate`
- add `@import '@framingui/ui/styles';` when using the FramingUI-native style contract
- generate a local `framingui-theme` module and mount `FramingUIProvider` in the app root
- register the MCP server in `.mcp.json`
- generate project guidance for `FRAMINGUI-GUIDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`

## Account and Quota

FramingUI is transitioning from template-first licensing to MCP tool-unit plans.

- `whoami` shows current theme entitlements and the shadow quota snapshot for the active billing window
- shadow quota is visible before hard enforcement so teams can estimate real workflow cost
- legacy theme or template customers keep their existing access during the migration window
- paid plans are moving toward included monthly tool units plus top-up or overage paths

## MCP Workflow

The production screen workflow is component-first and validation-first:

1. If the project path is known, call `detect-project-context` once to store the default platform/runtime for the session
2. `preview-theme` when theme recipes or defaults matter
3. `get-screen-generation-context`
4. `preview-component` for any ambiguous component contract
5. `list-icon-libraries` before introducing icons
6. `validate-screen-definition` for web screen-definition work
7. write code directly from the returned contract
8. `validate-environment` for dependency, style-contract, and code-audit checks

For Expo / React Native projects, start with `detect-project-context` so downstream discovery tools default to the native path automatically. If project path is unavailable, fall back to `platform: "react-native"` explicitly. In that path, use `@framingui/react-native` where the runtime surface exists, then fall back to host primitives or app-local abstractions for the rest.

FramingUI also provides slash-command guidance for common actions such as:

- `/screen`
- `/draft`
- `/section`
- `/responsive`
- `/a11y`
- `/theme-swap`
- `/doctor`
- `/install-check`
- `/export`
- `/update`

## Example MCP Config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "framingui": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@framingui/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Package Usage

Install packages directly when you need them without the guided MCP setup.

Web:

```bash
pnpm add @framingui/ui @framingui/core
```

```tsx
import '@framingui/ui/styles';
import { FramingUIProvider, Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@framingui/ui';
import framinguiTheme from './framingui-theme';

export function ExampleCard() {
  return (
    <FramingUIProvider theme={framinguiTheme}>
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>Ship product UI</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <Button>Open workflow</Button>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </FramingUIProvider>
  );
}
```

Expo / React Native:

```bash
pnpm add @framingui/react-native
```

```tsx
import { Button, Screen, TextField } from '@framingui/react-native';

export function SignupScreen() {
  return (
    <Screen width="narrow">
      <TextField label="Email" placeholder="name@example.com" />
      <Button label="Continue" />
    </Screen>
  );
}
```

## Quality Gates

MCP pipeline checks are split into two lanes:

- `pnpm ci:mcp:pr`: required pull-request gate for theme authority, screen contract, generation quality, and CSS variable regressions
- `pnpm ci:mcp:nightly`: heavier browser smoke lane intended for scheduled or manual execution

## Status

FramingUI is actively evolving around:

- MCP-native UI generation
- guarded direct-write workflows
- theme-aware component discovery
- production integration checks
